# Aleksi

Aleksi is a collection of useful Sass functions and mixins. It bundles other libraries and provides its own functions and mixins on top.

The firstname *Aleksi* means 'helper of man' in russian.

## Dependencies

Aleski requires the following Sass/Compass extensions to be installed:

+ [Sass (~> 3.3)](https://github.com/sass/sass)
+ [SassyCast (~> 1.1.1)](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyCast)
+ [SassyMath (~> 1.5)](https://github.com/at-import/sassy-math)
+ [SassyStrings (~> 1.1.4)](https://github.com/at-import/Sassy-Strings)
+ [SassyLists (~> 2.2)](https://github.com/at-import/SassyLists)
+ [Sassy-Maps (0.4.0)](https://github.com/at-import/Sassy-Maps/)

It won't load these extensions completely though â€” only the parts it needs. If you want to be sure you have access to an extensions full functionality, import its main stylesheet additionally (e.g. `@import "SassyLists";`).
