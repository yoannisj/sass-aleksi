# Aleksi

Aleksi is a collection of useful Sass functions and mixins. It bundles other libraries and provides its own functions and mixins on top.

The russian firstname *Aleksi* means *'helper of man'*.

## Dependencies and Bundling

Aleski requires Compass and will import only the needed parts from compass. Additionally, it depends on the following Sass/Compass extensions:

+ [Sass (~> 3.3)](https://github.com/sass/sass)
+ [SassyCast (~> 1.1.1)](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyCast)
+ [SassyMath (~> 1.5)](https://github.com/at-import/sassy-math)
+ [SassyStrings (~> 1.1.4)](https://github.com/at-import/Sassy-Strings)
+ [SassyLists (~> 2.2)](https://github.com/at-import/SassyLists)

These extensions are bundled with Aleksi, adding `@import "aleksi";` to your stylesheet will give you access to all their functionalities. Be sure to check out their respective documentations to take the most out of Aleksi.
